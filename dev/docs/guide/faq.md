#### Is the underlying layer of the C++ component library Python? Will there be any performance issues?

No, it is not. The C++ and Python component libraries are two separate sets of code. The C++ component library is developed entirely with C++ Qt and has no connection to Python. Therefore, there are no efficiency issues.



#### Is there a trial or subscription option for the C++ component library?

No. C++ only supports a one-time permanent purchase model. The pricing plans are available on the [pricing page](/price), and you can download the pre-compiled demo program `C++_QFluentWidgets.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/zhiyiYo/PyQt-Fluent-Widgets/releases) on GitHub for testing.

#### Which versions of Qt are supported by the C++ component library?

It supports Qt 5.15.x and Qt 6.x.x.

#### Does the C++ component library provide source code?

No, it does not. After purchase, you will receive header files and static libraries.

#### Can I use your C++ component library for free if I don't use it for commercial purposes?

No.

#### Does it support QML?

No, it does not. All components are developed based on QWidgets and will not support QML in the future.


#### Why does the title bar area of the mica window display the theme color?

This is because the interface uses mica effects and the user has enabled "Show accent color on title bars and window borders" in the system settings. The solution is to disable the mica effects or ask the user to disable "Show accent color on title bars and window borders".
