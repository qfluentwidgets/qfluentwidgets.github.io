#### Do I need to purchase a license to use the Python component library for commercial software?

Yes, the Python component library is licensed under dual licensing. The GPLv3 license is used for non-commercial use, while commercial projects must purchase a license from the [pricing page](/zh/price) to use the advanced version of the components. Subscriptions need to be renewed after expiration. Although the license price is equivalent to the cost of a cup of milk tea on average per month, it is of great significance for the sustainable development of the component library.

#### Does the commercial version support PyQt?

No, it does not. PyQt has stricter licensing. For commercial software, please use PySide6 (recommended) or PySide2.

#### Is there a trial or subscription option for the C++ component library?

No. C++ only supports a one-time permanent purchase model. The pricing plans are available on the [pricing page](/price), and you can download the pre-compiled demo program `C++_QFluentWidgets.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/zhiyiYo/PyQt-Fluent-Widgets/releases) on GitHub for testing. Currently, there are hundreds of thousands of devices running software that uses this component library. The library has also established deep collaborations with Fortune 500 companies, so you can trust its quality without any doubt!

#### Which versions of Qt are supported by the C++ component library?

It supports Qt 5.15.x and Qt 6.x.x.

#### Does the C++ component library provide source code?

No, it does not. After purchase, you will receive header files and static libraries.

#### Can I use your C++ component library for free if I don't use it for commercial purposes?

No.

#### Python is open source, why can't C++ be open source as well?

ðŸ˜…

#### Does it support QML?

No, it does not. All components are developed based on QWidgets and will not support QML in the future.

#### Is there an official community group?

Yes, there is. After following the author [ä¹‹ä¸€Yo](https://space.bilibili.com/471587058) on Bilibili, you can obtain the QQ group number.

#### Why does the title bar area of the mica window display the theme color?

This is because the interface uses mica effects and the user has enabled "Show accent color on title bars and window borders" in the system settings. The solution is to disable the mica effects or ask the user to disable "Show accent color on title bars and window borders".
