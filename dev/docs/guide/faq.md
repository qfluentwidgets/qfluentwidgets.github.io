#### Why does the title bar area of the Fluent Window display the accent color?

This is because the interface uses the mica effect and the user has enabled "Show accent color on title bars and window borders" in the system settings. The solution is to either disable the mica effect or have the user disable "Show accent color on title bars and window borders".

#### Do I need to purchase a license if I want to use the Python component library for a commercial software?

Yes, the Python component library is licensed under dual licenses. The GPLv3 license is used for non-commercial use, while commercial projects must purchase a license from the [pricing page](/zh/price). After purchasing a license, you can use the advanced version of the components. Although the license is priced at an average cost of a cup of milk tea per month, it is significant for the sustainable development of the component library.

#### Does the commercial version support PyQt?

No, it does not. PyQt has strict licensing terms. For commercial software, please use PySide6 (recommended) or PySide2.

#### Does the C++ component library support trial or subscription models?

No, it does not. The C++ component library only supports a one-time permanent purchase model. The pricing plans are available on the [pricing page](/zh/price), and you can download the precompiled demo program `QFluentWidgets_v*.*.*.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/zhiyiYo/PyQt-Fluent-Widgets/releases) on GitHub for preview purposes. Currently, software using this component library is running smoothly on hundreds of thousands of devices, so you can trust it completely!

#### Is there an official community group?

Yes, there is. After following the author [之一Yo](https://space.bilibili.com/471587058) on Bilibili, you can obtain the QQ group number.
