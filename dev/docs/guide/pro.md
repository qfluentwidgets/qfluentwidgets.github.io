## What is the QFluentWidgets Pro?

PySide6-Fluent-Widgets and PySide2-Fluent-Widgets are **dual-licensed**. They are licensed under GPLv3 for non-commercial use. For commercial use, you should purchase a [**commercial license**](/price).

To meet the needs of developers, the commercial version of the component library includes more advanced components. When combined with the open-source version of the component library, it makes modern interface development more convenient.

Currently, QFluentWidgets Pro includes the following components, and more components being added in the future:
